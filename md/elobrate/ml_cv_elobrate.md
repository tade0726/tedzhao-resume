**LLM Application for Financial Analysis**

- Leveraged LLMs for advanced semantic analysis in prompt engineering, developing tailored prompts to accurately categorize company descriptions and news feeds. This methodology facilitated the extraction of GICS-like themes, enhancing the understanding of company genres and industries for a structured corporate landscape overview.
- Innovated in creating a knowledge graph utilizing LLM's robust parsing capabilities to analyze and extract a diverse array of entities and their relationships from company news and descriptions, such as executives, competitors, and product logistics chains. Integrated this data into a graph database to support a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, significantly improving information retrieval and decision-making accuracy in financial contexts.


**ETL**

- Reduced original schema size by over 50% by designing and simplifying data models involving 30+ tables using the DBT framework, enhancing maintainability and system performance.
- Aligned date ranges across various data models to minimize batch data volumes, transforming disorganized schemas into deduplicated, well-documented models. Achieved a 15% reduction in redundant data storage, enhancing data retrieval efficiency.
- Conducted thorough analysis to identify and resolve bottlenecks in data flow. Improved system efficiency by re-indexing and aligning data types of join keys, and refining join conditions, resulting in a 50% reduction in query runtime.
- Integrated DBT with Dagster Cloud to develop a mixed orchestration framework combining notebook and DBT jobs. This approach unified heterogeneous data streams, enhancing the user interface and overall data presentation within the DBT framework.

**Recommendation Systems**

- Leveraged Databricks and MLflow to build and refine iterative machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and Deep Learning. Led the full cycle of model development, encompassing data collection, feature engineering, model training, and deployment. I achieved a **5-10% increase in CTR** with each iteration, demonstrating continuous improvement and impact.
  
**Computer Vision / Deep Learning**

- Leveraged ResNet to categorize hotel images into 20 detailed landscape and interior labels. Improved differentiation of similar categories by embedding nuanced business logic, resulting in a hierarchical labeling system that achieved **99% accuracy** in Top-5 predictions.
- Utilized MobileNet to refine thumbnail selection for hotels, focusing on aesthetic appeal and detail. This approach evolved aesthetic evaluation from a single-dimensional to a multi-dimensional framework, using semantic analysis and object recognition to enhance image selection, culminating in a **+3% increase in click-through rate (CTR)** after implementing the new strategy.

**ETL**

- Developed and maintained T+1 batch data processes, capturing long-term patterns in user behaviors. Utilized AWS Lambda to trigger Python scripts written in PySpark, storing data in Parquet format within a Databricks environment. This setup supports both model training and real-time inference needs.
- Engineered a real-time data streaming solution capturing user log data from Elasticsearch, facilitating the immediate tracking of user click behaviors. Implemented a Redis key-value store for rapid data access, integrating this stream with batch data to enhance the real-time data feed for inference. This integration improved the Click-Through Rate (CTR) by 2%, significantly impacting core profitability metrics.
